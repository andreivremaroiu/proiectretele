        "\n",
        "- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: This library is crucial for various stages of the machine learning pipeline:\n",
        "  - `train_test_split`: Helps in splitting the data into training and testing sets, which is necessary for training our models and evaluating their performance on unseen data.\n",
        "  - `LinearRegression`: Provides the implementation of the linear regression model, which we use as one of our predictive models to forecast television subscription rates.\n",
        "  - `mean_squared_error`, `mean_absolute_error`: These functions allow us to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of our models, which are key metrics for evaluating the accuracy of our predictions.\n",
        "  - `RandomForestRegressor`: An ensemble learning method based on randomized decision trees, known for its high accuracy in regression tasks. We use it to build a more complex model that can potentially capture nonlinear dependencies in the data.\n",
        "  - `GridSearchCV`: A tool for tuning model parameters (hyperparameters) to find the most effective model settings. It automates the process of finding the best parameters for the models, enhancing their performance by optimizing hyperparameter settings.\n",
